[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findcasadi.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "casadi", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "casadi" with any
  of the following names:

    casadiConfig.cmake
    casadi-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "casadi" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "casadi_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "casadi"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
